## üñºÔ∏è Image Preprocessing

To ensure consistency and optimal model performance, all images were preprocessed to a uniform size of 640x640 pixels. This standardization was crucial for effective training and inference.

## üèãÔ∏è Training with YOLOv8s

The YOLOv8s model was trained using the preprocessed and auto-labeled images. The training process involved fine-tuning various hyperparameters to achieve the best possible performance.


## üìä Results

The trained YOLOv8s model demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying different types of fungi. Key metrics and visual examples of the model's predictions are highlighted below, showcasing its accuracy and robustness.
